Bear with me till the end\nof this course I hope you’ll love this magic box.\n\nBut now let’s start by answering the question – why docker?\n\nMay be in the middle of the night you woke up seeing a dream of million dollar\nidea and decided to write the application right away. The application has some\nlife cycle. First you have to build the application, then run it, then\ndistribute it then you need to maintain or manage the application.\n\nYou decided to write the application but you’ve some dependencies for that like\nlanguage, dbs, servers, tools etc.\n\nLet’s just imagine you’ll be needing these following technologies to build your\napplication\n\n * JDK (v1.8)\n * Maven ( 3.6.2)\n * Apache Tomcat (v8.5.47)\n * Redis (v5.0.6)\n * MySQL (v8.0.18)\n * MongoDB 4.2.1\n\nYou started installing each of those in your system. But CRAP!! You might have\nfaced something like this scenario.\n\nSometimes or should I say most of the times running an installer leads to an\nerror. You troubleshoot it, then re run it and then get another error. Again\ntroubleshoot it and re-run. And may be finally doing these steps a few times you\nsuccessfully install the dependency in your system. But in the meantime, you’ve\nsuccessfully wasted 8-10 hours just for creating a development environment in\nyour computer. Phew.. Finally you started actual coding.\n\nMay be after developing some modules you decided to hire 3 more people for your\nproject.\n\nAnd guess what! Each of them started by doing installing the dependencies. And\nthey need to setup the exact same version of your environment. Maybe they\nalready had installed some of the dependencies with older version. It will\nconflict with the newer version. At the end each of them waste some amounts of\ntimes just for getting their environment ready. What a shameful way of wasting\ntime!!\n\nEach of the team members need exact same version of every tools and technologies\n\nIf you can relate this with yourself, don’t be sad, you’re not alone. Most of\nthe developer has faced these issues in their lifetime.\n\nIf I say with the help of docker you’ll never face something like this ever! Yes\nyou heard me right. You just need docker installed in you machine and then\ndocker guarantees you will never see something like this ever in your life.\n\nYou just say something like this\n\ndocker run mongo\n\n\nBut is this the only reason why you’ll use docker? Probably not. It’s something\nyou get from docker out of the box, it’s really helpful for a developer but\nthere are other tools as well for doing just this. There are much greater reason\nfor using docker. And we’ll talk about that in the next lesson.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/Docker_Tutorial.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"6090f5eb5ba69560ccfcf0d2","created_at":"2021-05-05T11:57:10.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T21:31:47.000Z","published_at":"2021-05-05T11:59:29.000Z","custom_excerpt":"If I start explaining what is Docker, it probably won’t be understandable at first.

For network performance it is usually better to make fewer requests instead of more requests with less data.</p><p>However, before adding support for bulk operations you should think twice if this feature is really needed. Often network performance is not what limits request throughput. You should also consider techniques like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HTTP pipelining</a> as alternative to improve performance.</p><p>When implementing bulk operations we should differentiate between two different cases:</p><ul><li>Bulk operations that group together many arbitrary operations in one request. For example: <em>Delete product with id 42</em>, <em>create a user named John</em> and <em>retrieve all product-reviews created yesterday</em>.</li><li>Bulk operations that perform one operation on different resources of the same type. For example: <em>Delete the products with id 23, 45, 67 and 89</em>.</li></ul><p>In the next section we will explore different solutions that can help us with both situations. Be aware that the shown solutions might not look very REST-like. Bulk operations in general are not very compatible with REST constraints as we operate on different resources with a single request. So there simply is no real REST solution.</p><p>In the following examples we will always return a synchronous response. However, as bulk operations usually take longer to process it is likely you are also interested in an asynchronous processing style. In this case, my post about <a href=\"https://www.mscharhag.com/api-design/rest-asynchronous-operations\" rel=\"noopener\">asynchronous operations with REST</a> might also be interesting to you.</p><h2 id=\"expressing-multiple-operations-within-the-request-body\">Expressing multiple operations within the request body</h2><p>Probably a way that comes to mind quickly is to use a standard data format like JSON to define a list of desired operations.</p><p>Let’s start with a simple example request:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"padding: 0px !important;

This can help reduce networking overhead. For\nnetwork performance it is usually better to make fewer requests instead of more\nrequests with less data.\n\nHowever, before adding support for bulk operations you should think twice if\nthis feature is really needed. Often network performance is not what limits\nrequest throughput. You should also consider techniques like HTTP pipelining\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining] as alternative to improve\nperformance.\n\nWhen implementing bulk operations we should differentiate between two different\ncases:\n\n * Bulk operations that group together many arbitrary operations in one request.\n   For example: Delete product with id 42, create a user named John and retrieve\n   all product-reviews created yesterday.\n * Bulk operations that perform one operation on different resources of the same\n   type. For example: Delete the products with id 23, 45, 67 and 89.\n\nIn the next section we will explore different solutions that can help us with\nboth situations. Be aware that the shown solutions might not look very\nREST-like. Bulk operations in general are not very compatible with REST\nconstraints as we operate on different resources with a single request. So there\nsimply is no real REST solution.\n\nIn the following examples we will always return a synchronous response. However,\nas bulk operations usually take longer to process it is likely you are also\ninterested in an asynchronous processing style. In this case, my post about \nasynchronous operations with REST\n[https://www.mscharhag.com/api-design/rest-asynchronous-operations] might also\nbe interesting to you.\n\nExpressing multiple operations within the request body\nProbably a way that comes to mind quickly is to use a standard data format like\nJSON to define a list of desired operations.\n\nLet’s start with a simple example request:\n\n1POST /batch1234567[{\"path\":\"/products\",\"method\":\"post\",\"body\": {\"name\":\n\"Cool Gadget\",\"price\": \"1nbsp;12.45USD\"         }     }, {         \"path\": \"\n/users/43\",         \"method\": \"put\",         \"body\": {             \"name\": \"\nPaul\"         }     },     ... ]We use a generic /batch endpoint that accepts a simple JSON format to describe\ndesired operations using URIs and HTTP methods.
